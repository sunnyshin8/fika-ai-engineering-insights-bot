### üöÄ Hiring Opportunity

**We're hiring!** This challenge is part of our recruitment process for engineering positions. We offer both **remote** and **on-site** work options to accommodate your preferences and lifestyle.

### 1 ‚ú¶ Context

We need a chat-first, AI-powered view of how every engineer and squad are performing‚Äîboth technically and in terms of business value shipped. Build a **minimum-viable product (MVP)** in fewer than seven days that delivers these insights inside Slack **or** Discord.

### 2 ‚ú¶ Core MVP Requirements (non-negotiables)

| Area                     | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent-centric design** | Use **LangChain + LangGraph** agents written in **Python 3.10+**. Provide at least two clear roles‚Äî*Data Harvester* and *Diff Analyst*‚Äîhanding off to an *Insight Narrator* agent via LangGraph edges.                                                        |
| **Data ingestion**       | Pull GitHub events via REST or webhooks. The commits API exposes `additions`, `deletions`, `changed_files` per commit ([docs.github.com][3]); the *List PR files* endpoint gives the same per-file counts ([docs.github.com][4]).                             |
| **Metrics**              | Track commits, PR throughput, review latency, cycle time, CI failures **plus per-author diff stats** (lines ¬±, files touched). Optionally fall back to `git log --numstat` for local analysis ([stackoverflow.com][5]).                                       |
| **Diff analytics layer** | Your *Diff Analyst* agent aggregates churn, flags spikes, and links code-churn outliers to defect risk (research shows churn correlates with bugs) ([stackoverflow.com][6]).                                                                                  |
| **AI insight layer**     | Agents transform data into daily, weekly, monthly narratives that map to DORA‚Äôs four keys (lead-time, deploy frequency, change-failure, MTTR) ([dora.dev][7]). Log every prompt/response for auditability.                                                    |
| **Chat-first output**    | A **Slack bot** (Bolt Python SDK) ([api.slack.com][8]) or **Discord bot** (discord.js slash-command with embeds) ([discordjs.guide][9]) must, on `/dev-report weekly`, post a chart/table + the agent summary. JSON API is optional but the bot is mandatory. |
| **MVP polish**           | One-command bootstrap (`docker compose up` or `make run`). Include a seed script with fake GitHub events so reviewers see data instantly.                                                                                                                     |
| **Docs**                 | `README.md` with bot install guide and an architecture diagram showing LangGraph nodes/edges, storage and chat layer.                                                                                                                                         |
